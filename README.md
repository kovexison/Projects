Projects linked in my resume
Folders: 
- System Identification Project: Part 1: Linear Regression, Part 2: Nonlinear ARX model. It was done in collavboration with 2 of my collegaues from the faculty. The MATLAB code was written by me.
- Systems Theory Project: pdf, modelling an electronic circuit and applying all of my ST1 knowledge on it, based on some requirements.
- Power Electronics Project: A step-down transformer, rectifying bridge, as DC current source, then making a stabilized step-down source with transistors and PWM signal from an analogicc PI regulator. It can be found as pdf file.
- Java - Simple Banking System project: it was done to demonstrate my basic knowledge of Java SE. Using database, real card-number generator engine.
- Arduino - Intelligent Home project:  basic project with basic arduino knowledge.
- Control Engineering Project: *not finalized* Making a PID controller for a quadcopter drone. - In collaboration with Bosch through a scholarship.
- Industrial Informatics Project: *not finalized*  Car Game with C#, using databases. In collaboration with 2 collegaues.
- FPGA Project - DIGILENT: *not finalized* Coding in VHDL basic circuits with Basys 3 FPGA and Zybo Z7.
